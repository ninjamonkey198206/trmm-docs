and `{}` indicates a parameter with several preconfigured parameter

and `()` indicates a default parameter if none is specified.

### Run Script on many agents at once

Under the `Tools menu` -> `Bulk Script` you can execute scripts against Clients/Sites/Selected Agents/All based on All/Servers/Workstations. The history is saved in the history tab of the agent. The history can also be retrieved from the API from the `/agents/history/` endpoint.

### Run Command on many agents at once

Under the `Tools menu` -> `Bulk Command` you can execute a command against Clients/Sites/Selected Agents/All based on All/Servers/Workstations. The history is saved in the history tab of the agent. The history can also be retrieved from the API from the `/agents/history/` endpoint.

### Automated Tasks

Tactical RMM allows scheduling tasks to run on agents. This leverages the Windows Task Scheduler and has the same scheduling options.

See [Automated Tasks](automated_tasks.md) for configuring automated tasks.

### Script Checks

Scripts can also be run periodically on an agent and trigger an alert if it fails.

### Alert Failure/Resolve Actions

Scripts can be triggered when an alert is triggered and resolved. This script will run on any online agent and supports passing the alert information as arguments. 

For configuring **Alert Templates**, see [Alerting](./alerting.md)

See below for populating dashboard data in scripts and the available options.

## Using dashboard data in scripts

Tactical RMM allows passing in dashboard data to scripts as arguments. The below powershell arguments will get the client name of the agent and also the agent's public IP address.

```
-ClientName {{client.name}} -PublicIP {{agent.public_ip}}
```

!!!info
    Everything between {{}} is CaSe sEnSiTive

See a full list of possible built-in variables [Here](../script_variables.md)

### Getting Custom Field values

Tactical RMM supports pulling data from custom fields using the {{model.custom_field_name}} syntax.

See [Using Custom Fields in Scripts](custom_fields.md#Using Custom Fields in Scripts).

### Getting values from the Global Keystore

Tactical RMM supports getting values from the global key store using the {{global.key_name}} syntax.

See [Global Keystore](keystore.md).

### Example Powershell Script

The below script takes five named values. The arguments will look like this: `-SiteName {{site.name}} -ClientName {{client.name}} -PublicIP {{agent.public_ip}} -CustomField {{client.AV_KEY}} -Global {{global.API_KEY}}`

```powershell
param (
   [string] $SiteName,
   [string] $ClientName,
   [string] $PublicIp,
   [string] $CustomField,
   [string] $Global
)

Write-Output "Site: $SiteName"
Write-Output "Client: $ClientName"
Write-Output "Public IP: $PublicIp"
Write-Output "Custom Fields: $CustomField"
Write-Output "Global: $Global"
```

## Script Snippets

Script Snippets allow you to create common code blocks or comments and apply them to all of your scripts. This could be initialization code, common error checking, or even code comments. 

### Adding Script Snippets

In the dashboard, browse to **Settings > Scripts Manager**. Click the **Script Snippets** button.

- **Name** - This identifies the script snippet in the dashboard
- **Description** - Optional description for the script snippet
- **Shell** - This sets the language of the script. Available options are:
    - Powershell
    - Windows Batch
    - Python

### Using Script Snippets

When editing a script, you can add template tags to the script body that contains the script snippet name. For example, if a script snippet exists with the name "Check WMF", you would put {{Check WMF}} in the script body and the snippet code will be replaced.

!!!info

The template tags will only be visible when Editing the script. When downloading or viewing the script code the template tags will be replaced with the script snippet code.
